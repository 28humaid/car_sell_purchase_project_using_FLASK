# car_sell_purchase_project_using_FLASK

This a web application made using HTML,CSS and flask (for both backend and frontend) development. For CSS I have also used bootstrap. In this application a user first needs to login and then he can use this application. The opearations s/he can perform include add car details to sell, update his/her car details, see the list of cars to purchase and also s/he can update his/her information.
Apart from all these basic operations the user can also add a feedback and can also see the reviews of other people who have been on this platform.
Obviously after the user has used this application then s/he can logout also
